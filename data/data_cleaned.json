Please have a look at the attached file and be ready to make a presentation for approximately one hour plus minus. Of course, it can be shorter, but the main point is to take the most important points from each subject to teach all of us (which may be helpful for everyone in the team in the end \ud83d\ude0a ). One more thing: As you can see in the file, there will be a little all-along-year competition -> We agreed that this can be a good way to keep some significant technical features in our heads. \ud83d\ude0a Every 5 subjects there will be a space for your ideas and suggestions what we can improve and develop, how to think up a better approach to any functionality or whatever. All good ideas or proposals on how to make our work easier, everything will be welcome! One last point: The online quiz will be handled during the meeting and will contain two questions from each subject, one easier question (1 point) and one more difficult one (2 points for the right answer). And one more last point: at the end of our training sessions you can expect a very nice prize if you are ranked in the highest places \ud83d\ude0a And what will be the prizes? You can expect something good enough to fight for it, haha! So keep learning and make our knowledge better! \ud83d\ude0a Any suggestions are welcome, of course. We are starting this week on Thursday at 13:00. This event will be held every Thursday at the same time. Thank you all! Kind regards, Radim",
